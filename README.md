# Robot_IDM

# Theme:
Use of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) to build Dedicated Languages (DSL).

# Keywords:
Model Driven Engineering (MDE), code generation, static semantics, structural semantics, syntax abstract, concrete syntax.

# Objectives:
- Demonstrate the usefulness of model-driven engineering to build domain-specific languages specific (DSL for Domain Specific Language in English). These languages allow to have a model of high level specification.
- Use IDM techniques and associated tools such as metamodeling, structural verification, code generation and model transformation.

# Introduction:
In this project, we build the project in Eclipse using the domain-specific language (DSL) to run the NXT robot. The objective aims to build the program at high level, be close to the user and easy to handle the standard languages (Java, C++).
