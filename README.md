# Robot_IDM

# Theme:
Use of Model Driven Engineering (MDE) to build Dedicated Languages (DSL).

# Keywords:
Model Driven Engineering (MDE), code generation, static semantics, structural semantics, syntax abstract, concrete syntax.

# Objectives:
- Demonstrate the usefulness of model-driven engineering to build domain-specific languages specific (DSL for Domain Specific Language in English). These languages allow to have a model of high level specification.
- Use IDM techniques and associated tools such as metamodeling, structural verification, code generation and model transformation
